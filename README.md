Pocket Reader: Aplicativo de convers√£o de texto impresso em voz para deficientes visuais
Pocket Reader: Apliction for printed text conversion into voice to the visualy impaired


This is an iOS app that (should) guide the blind user to find a sheet of printed text, take a picture of it, conver to to text and read it loud with Voice Over.

Have fun looking through the code. This is our very first iOS project (programming project at all), if you find any errors please make a pull request.
