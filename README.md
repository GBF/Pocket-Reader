Pocket Reader: Application for printed text conversion into voice to the visualy impaired


Designed and developed for visually impaired and blind users, this app converts printed texts into digital texts, reading them with VoiceOver right after the conversion. The app offers a guide for framing the sheet with the printed text: following the directions given by the app through VoiceOver, the user finds the sheet by moving the device, and, when the sheet is fully on frame, the app takes a picture automatically, convert the image to text and then speaks the converted text out loud. Also, the text is stored inside the app, so that the user can hear older converted texts to retrieve information. On the app settings, the language to be used in the conversion form image to text can also be changed, so that documents in foreign languages can be successfully converted: English, French, German, Portuguese and Spanish are available.


Have fun looking through the code. This is our very first iOS project (programming project at all), if you find any errors please warn us.
